                Hello! I'm Kamran Haider, a passionate Frontend Developer specializing in
                 React and Next.js. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer 
                 System Engineering at Dawood University of Engineering and Technology,
                  Karachi. I have a strong grasp of modern frontend technologies,
                 including Redux Toolkit, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                Iâ€™ve also explored backend development with Node.js and have a
                 growing interest in blockchain technology, which I studied through a
                 course offered by the National Vocational and Technical Training
                  Commission (NVTTC).
                </p>
                <p>
                With a focus on building responsive, user-friendly,
                 and visually appealing web applications, I have developed
                  several projects, including my latest, Haider Mega Blogs
                   Website, which allows users to create and manage posts.
                 I also have hands-on experience with integrating e-commerce tools and platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
